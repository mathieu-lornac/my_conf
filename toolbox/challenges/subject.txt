A robot can be programmed to run 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 km and it takes 10, 5, 3, 2 and 1 minutes respectively.
Once it runs to programmed km, it must be turned off for 2 min.

After 2 min, it can again be programmed to run for a further 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 km.

How would you programm this robot to go exactly 43 km in minimum amount of time?

=> print the correct sequence of distances to be programmed.
Pay attention to design, data struct, dyn prog, faster exec times and create generic solutions.
Compute and provide Big O notation for main piece of ur solution too.
